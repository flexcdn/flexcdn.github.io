</p>
<p>
    For all questions regarding data protection in connection with the use of the Application, you can also contact our <strong>Data Protection Officer</strong> at any time.
</p>
<p>

<h2>
    2. What the Application can be used for
</h2>
<p>
    The purpose of the FULL ADHD mobile Application is to encourage users to maintain their own health and that of their loved ones. The App is designed to help users identify ADHD, its symptoms, as well as the risk factors, and to support users in obtaining additional information about the treatment of ADHD. The mobile Application is not intended to diagnose a disease and it does not replace the consultation of a doctor. The App is intended for people aged 16 and over.
</p>
<h2>
    3. How we process the information
</h2>
<p>
    The personal data and information that we process about you (collectively and individually, the "Information", "Data") include:
</p>
<h3>
    3.1 Push Notifications
</h3>
<p>
    When you first open the App, you may be asked if you want to receive push notifications. This allows us to inform you about events or functionalities while the App is running in the background. You can disable or enable these features at any time using the notification options in your device settings. In order to be able to send you push notifications, we use the push notification services of Google LLC or Apple, Inc. as processors, depending on the device. Since Google LLC is certified under the Data Privacy Framework (adequacy decision), there is an adequate level of protection when transferring data to the USA. Apple Inc., on the other hand, is not certified under the Data Privacy Framework, which is based both a data processing agreement and standard contractual clauses with both Google Inc. and Apple Inc. and have taken further measures to ensure an adequate level of data protection, see also Section 7. The legal basis for the push notifications is your consent, which can be revoked at any time, in accordance with Art. 6 (1) (a) the UK GDPR.
</p>
<h3>
    3.2 Contacting Us
</h3>
<p>
    If you need user assistance or technical support, please contact us using the contact button directly in the Application.

Takeda has Appointed a Data Protection Officer which you may contact at privacyoffice@takeda.com with any questions or requests.
</p>
<p>
    The legal basis for this processing is Art. 6 (1) (b) the UK GDPR, insofar as your information is required to answer your enquiry or to initiate or execute a contract, and otherwise Art. 6 (1) (f) the UK GDPR on the basis of our legitimate interest in you contacting us and for us to be able to answer your enquiry. This is a legitimate user service that originates from the user.
</p>
<p>
    The data collected by us when you contact us will be stored for a period of 3 months and then deleted, unless we still need your request to fulfil contractual or legal obligations.
</p>
<h3>
    3.3 Data processed during the game
</h3>

</p>
<p>
    Takeda does not attempt to identify users on the basis of the Data processed by Takeda and strives to aggregate and minimise the data so that the user cannot be identified on the basis of the data.

<h2>
    7. Where we store your data
</h2>
<p>
    Your data is stored on your mobile phone or pad. As explained in this privacy policy, we use services whose providers are partly located in so-called third countries (outside the UK, European Union or the European Economic Area) or process the Data there, i.e. countries whose level of data protection does not correspond to that of the UK and European Union. To the extent that this is the case and there is not an adequacy decision (Art. 45 the UK GDPR) for these countries, we have taken Appropriate precautions to ensure an adequate level of data protection for any data transfers. There is an adequacy decision for the USA; in cases where the providers are not registered in the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, we have also taken Appropriate precautions. These include, among others, the standard contractual clauses or binding internal data protection regulations.
</p>
<p>
    Where this is not possible, we base the data transfer on exceptions to Art. 49 the UK GDPR, in particular your express consent or the necessity of the transfer for the performance of the contract or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures.
</p>
<p>
    If a transfer to a third country is provided for and there is no adequacy decision or suitable safeguards, it is possible and there is a risk that authorities in the respective third country (e.g. intelligence services) can gain access to the transmitted data in order to collect and analyse it, and that the enforceability of your rights as a data subject cannot be guaranteed.
