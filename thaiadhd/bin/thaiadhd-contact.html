    <em><strong>Adverse Event and Product Complaint Reporting</strong></em>
</p>
<p>
    Adverse Events in the UK should be reported through the Yellow Card Scheme. Reporting forms and information can be found at <a class="display-custom-link" href="https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/"><strong>www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard</strong></a>. Patients can report through the Yellow Card Scheme as well so don’t need to consult a doctor first if reporting an Adverse Event.
